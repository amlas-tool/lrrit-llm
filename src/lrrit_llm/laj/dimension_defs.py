  "D1": "Compassionate engagement with people affected: assess evidence of empathy, communication, support, duty of candour tone; avoid purely clinical narration.",
  "D2": "Systems approach to contributory factors: focus on system conditions and interactions, not individual blame; identify latent factors and work-as-done.",
  "D3": "Quality and appropriateness of learning actions: actions should be specific, feasible, risk-relevant, and linked to contributory factors; avoid safety clutter.",
  "D4": "Blame language avoided: avoid person-focused blame; prefer neutral/system framing; flag person-cues/blame cues where present.",
  "D5": "Local rationality: explain why actions made sense at the time given information/constraints; avoid counterfactual outcome arguments.",
  "D6": "Avoid hindsight bias/counterfactual certainty: be cautious about outcome attribution; recognise uncertainty; avoid definitive unsupported counterfactual claims.",
  "D7": "Improvement actions: system-focused, evidence-informed, collaboratively developed, with ownership/monitoring; avoid generic compliance-heavy actions.",
  "D8": "Communication quality/usability: clear structure, readable narrative, jargon managed, learning/actions easy to extract."
