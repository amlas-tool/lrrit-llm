D3 – Quality and appropriateness of learning actions

Purpose

Assess whether the learning actions identified in the response are appropriate, proportionate, and likely to reduce recurrence, given the contributory factors identified.

This dimension evaluates what is done with the learning, not whether causes were correctly identified (D2), nor whether blame is avoided (D4).

Scope
In scope

Specificity and clarity of learning actions

Alignment between identified issues and proposed actions

Whether actions are actionable, testable, and sustainable

Whether actions target system change vs. superficial reminders

Out of scope

Correctness of clinical decisions

Compassionate engagement (D1)

Systems framing per se (D2)

Assignment of responsibility/blame (D4)

Judgement criteria
GOOD evidence

Clear, concrete learning actions

Actions are linked to contributory factors

Actions are system-level, embedded into pathways, escalation rules, governance, or tooling

Actions are specific enough to be implemented and reviewed

SOME evidence

Learning actions are present but:

are partially generic, or

mix system actions with individual reminders, or

lack clarity on implementation or ownership

LITTLE evidence

Learning actions are vague, generic, or absent

Actions rely mainly on individual reflection, awareness, or “be more careful”

No clear link between issues identified and actions proposed

Evidence polarity

positive: concrete, system-embedded learning actions (process changes, protocols, escalation rules, audits, tooling)

negative: vague actions, individual reflection/appraisal only, reminders without structural change, or absence of learning actions

Constraints

Do not infer the effectiveness of actions beyond what is stated

Do not credit “learning points” unless they specify an action

Prefer verbatim quotes that show what will change and how

Interaction with LaJ

LaJ should assess:

Whether actions logically address cited problems

Whether a GOOD rating is supported by specific, actionable evidence

Whether LITTLE ratings are justified by absence or vagueness
