LRRIT scoring rubric v2

Evidence classification

Positive evidence

Explicit description of:

what information was available at the time

how it was interpreted

what goals or trade-offs were being managed

what constraints shaped perceived options

Language that makes actions intelligible, even if outcomes were poor

Negative evidence

Descriptions or evaluations of actions without explaining contemporaneous reasoning

Retrospective judgement not grounded in lived context

Listing “pressures” or “constraints” without linking them to decision-making

Ratings

GOOD: Clear reconstruction of sense-making; actions intelligible in context

SOME: Partial or uneven reconstruction
